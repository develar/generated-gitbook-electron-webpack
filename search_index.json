\n\nBecause setting up webpack in the electron environment shouldn't be difficult.\n\nOverview\nModern web development practices today require a lot of setup with things like webpack to bundle your code, babel for transpiling, eslint for linting, and so much more that the list just goes on. Unfortunately when creating electron applications, all of that setup just became much more difficult. The primary aim of electron-webpack is to eliminate all preliminary setup with one simple install so you can get back to developing your application.\n\nWhy create a module and not a full boilerplate?\n\nIf you've been in the JavaScript world for even a short period of time, you are very aware that things are always changing, and development setup is no exclusion. Putting all development scripts into a single updatable module just makes sense. Sure a full featured boilerplate works too, but doing also involves needing to manually update those pesky webpack configuration files that some may call magic when something new comes out.\nHere are some of the awesome features you'll find using electron-webpack...\n\nDetailed documentation\nUse of webpack for source code bundling\nUse of webpack-dev-server for development\nHMR for both renderer and main processes\nUse of @babel/preset-env that is automatically configured based on your electron version\nAbility to add custom webpack loaders, plugins, etc.\nAdd-ons to support items like TypeScript, Less, EJS, etc.\n\nQuick Start\nGet started fast with electron-webpack-quick-start.\n# create a directory of your choice, and copy template using curl\nmkdir my-project && cd my-project\ncurl -fsSL https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-webpack-quick-start/archive/master.tar.gz | tar -xz --strip-components 1\n\n# or copy template using git clone\ngit clone https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-webpack-quick-start.git\ncd electron-webpack-quick-start\nrm -rf .git\n\n# install dependencies\nyarn\n\nIf you already have an existing project, or are looking for a custom approach outside of the quick start template, make sure to read over the Core Concepts, Project Structure, and Development sections of electron-webpack's documentation.\nNext Steps\nMake sure to take advantage of the detailed documentation that electron-webpack provides. It covers everything from how things work internally, adding custom configurations, and building your application.\n"},"core-concepts":{"url":"core-concepts","title":"Core Concepts","keywords":"","body":"Core Concepts\nBelow is a general overview of what electron-webpack aims to solve, and what it isn't.\nelectron-webpack is a module\nIt is not a fully featured boilerplate; it is a single updatable package. It includes many webpack configurations to help jump-start your development needs. If you are looking for a boilerplate to get started, please see electron-webpack-quick-start.\nelectron-webpack has a CLI\nYou can take use of a few useful commands such as running in development and compiling your source code (more info).\nelectron-webpack can be extended\nBy using electron-webpack you are not restricted to any sort of API abstraction of webpack. Although there are Add-ons made available to simplify smaller tasks, the entirety of webpack's documentation is fully applicable (more info).\nelectron-webpack is agnostic\nAside from setting up core webpack configurations with @babel/preset-env and making optimizations specific to the electron environment, electron-webpack does its best to not impose or encourage any sort of project structure or build cycle. Just as stated before, this is a module and can be used as tool outside of its CLI.\n"},"development":{"url":"development","title":"Development","keywords":"","body":"Development\nInstallation\nSince electron-webpack is a module, not a boilerplate, let's install that and few other dependencies.\nyarn add electron-webpack electron webpack --dev\nyarn add source-map-support\n\nStarting in development mode\nBy default, electron-webpack expects, at minimum, a main process entry point in src/main/index.js (more info). Once you have your entry files setup, you can run electron-webpack dev to get started. To make things easier, make use of setting up a script in your package.json to start your application in development mode.\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"electron-webpack dev\"\n  }\n}\n\nIf you are using electron-webpack-quick-start and have already installed dependecies, simply run the follwing to open your application in development mode.\nyarn dev\n\n\nSource Aliases\nelectron-webpack provides a few source aliases, or path mappings as TypeScript would call it, that allow you to import your modules easier.\n\n@: Provides path to corresponding process (main or renderer)\ncommon: Provides path to common source directory\n\n\nA little note on the magic\nelectron-webpack may seem like a magical module to some from the outside, but let's cover a few topics about what's going on under the hood.\nHot Module Replacement\nWebpack HMR has been setup to support both the renderer and main process. This allows for faster development ensuring your application is only restarted when neccessary.\nBundling for both renderer and main processes\nwebpack is already setup to have an entry point for each process. In addition, you can also easily add further entry points to the main process when needed. In the other cases where you just need support for the main process, you can even skip the renderer process when needed (more info).\nUse of html-webpack-plugin\nYou might notice that you don't need an index.html to get started on your application. That's because it is created for you, as it adds in a few extra configurations needed for the electron environment. If you are creating an electron application with webpack, you are most likely creating a Single Page Application anyways. So because of that, there is already a  provided in the markup that you can mount your application onto.\n\nA Note for Windows Users\nIf you run into errors while installing dependencies, related to node-gyp, then you most likely do not have the proper build tools installed on your system. Build tools include items like Python and Visual Studio.\nYou can quickly install these build tools by globally installing windows-build-tools. It provides many items like Visuall C++ packages, Python, and much more.\n"},"add-ons":{"url":"add-ons","title":"Add-ons","keywords":"","body":"Add-ons\nAlthough electron-webpack is provided as a single module, you can also install add-ons. Add-ons are made available to help setup certain frameworks that may require a lot of extra configuration or dependencies, such as TypeScript or Vue.js.\nThese add-ons are completely optional and may not support all use cases.

Unfortunately, there can be a few situations where this behavior may not be expected by some modules. For the case of some Vue UI libraries that provide raw *.vue components, they will needed to be white-listed.

If you are unfamiliar with the webpack.DllPlugin plugin, make sure to read its documentation to better understand what problem it attempts to solve. In short, this can be used to drastically improve build time performance.\nThrough custom configurations electron-webpack provides a place to define specific packages you would like to create a separate bundle for. You can treat this feature as a way to bundle all of your vendor libraries together.\nOnce you have defined your modules, you can simply run electron-webpack dll to produce a vendor bundle that will be referenced in your final compilation. Let's go through that step-by-step.\nDefine your modules\nHere we are defining our modules in package.json.

For most cases, you may only need to run this one time. But as you add/remove modules or even update those modules, you will need to re-run the command to create an updated bundle.\nUsing a postinstall hook\nOne common practice when using Dll bundle splitting to define a postinstall command to create the vendor bundle whenever new dependecies are installed. This can help ensure everything is up to date so you don't have to manually run this yourself.\npackage.json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"postinstall\": \"electron-webpack dll\"\n  }\n}\n\n"},"environment-variables":{"url":"environment-variables","title":"Environment Variables","keywords":"","body":"Environment Variables\nSometimes you need your webpack build to be dependent upon specific environment variables.

Of course there isn't a configuration that fits everybody's need, and electron-webpack is aware of that.\nThanks to the power of webpack-merge, it is possible to apply your own webpack loaders, plugins, etc. You can easily define your own webpack additions, and electron-webpack will internally merge those additions with its predefined configuration. The benefit of using this method, as opposed to Extending as a Library, is that you don't lose access to using the electron-webpack CLI, which is very beneficial for development.\nCustom modifications can be made for the renderer, renderer-dll, and main processes. Since webpack-merge is used, you can use the full potential of webpack's configuration API. See Configuration for more information.\nUse Case\nLet's say our project needs to be able to import *.txt files in the renderer process.

This is especially important when we need to use modules like fs or those that require a file path to an asset. electron-webpack is aware of that issue and provides a solution.\nYou may have noticed in Project Structure there is a directory specifically for static assets (static/). It is here where we can put assets we explicity don't want webpack to bundle. So now how can we access their path?\nUsing the __static variable\nSimilar to how __dirname can provide you with a path to the parent directory name when working in a Node.js environment, __static is made available to provide you a path to your static/ folder. This variable is available in both development and production.\nUse Case\nLet's say we have a static Text file (foobar.txt) we need to read into our application using fs. Here's how we can use the __static variable to get a reliable path to our asset.\nstatic/foobar.txt\nfoobarbizzbuzz\n\nsomeScript.js (main or renderer process)\nimport fs from 'fs'\nimport path from 'path'\n\n/* use `path` to create the full path to our asset */\nconst pathToAsset = path.join(__static, '/foobar.txt')\n\n/* use `fs` to consume the path and read our asset */\nconst fileContents = fs.readFileSync(pathToAsset, 'utf8')\n\nconsole.log(fileContents)\n// => \"foobarbizzbuzz\"\n\n"},"project-structure":{"url":"project-structure","title":"Project Structure","keywords":"","body":"Project Structure\nEverybody likes to structure their projects differently, and electron-webpack is aware of that.

The only concern of this module is to create a webpack output that functions properly and is optimized for the electron enviroment.\nCompiling your code\nOnce you have electron-webpack configured for your project, you can simply run the electron-webpack command to compile your source code. To make things easier, make use of setting up a script in your package.json.\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"compile\": \"electron-webpack\"\n  }\n}\n\nAfter running the above script with yarn compile, you now have a webpack output located in the dist/ directory.\nBuilding a distribution\nNow that electron-webpack has created your webpack bundle, you can simply implement any build tool you would like. One thing to note is that additional optimizations have been made to work with electron-builder. This build tool is perfect for any sized application, providing many features from creating installable executables to providing \"auto update\" support. electron-webpack also interally provides a base configuration for electron-builder.\nUsing electron-builder\nInstall\nyarn add electron-builder --dev\n\nAdd additional package.json scripts\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    /* compile source code and create webpack output */\n    \"compile\": \"electron-webpack\",\n\n    /* `yarn compile` & create distribution */\n    \"dist\": \"yarn compile && electron-builder\",\n\n    /* `yarn dist` & create unpacked distribution */\n    \"dist:dir\": \"yarn dist -- --dir -c.compression=store -c.mac.identity=null\"\n  }\n}\n\nFurther configurations can be made in accordance to electron-builder's documentation.\nFinal Notes\nWhen configuring your build tool of choice, just be sure to point to the dist/ directory where your compiled application lives (this is already the default of electron-builder).

To make sure everybody is on the same page, make sure to take a look at the below documentation.\nUsing yarn\nAs previously mentioned, the use of the yarn package manager is strongly recommened, as opposed to npm. Aside from a more stable dependency tree, one other major benefit to using yarn is the ability to clean your node_modules to help eliminate redudant files that will help reduce your application's final build size.\npackage.json\ndependencies\nThese dependencies will be included in your final production application.

It surely has its place in the community, but just isn't comparable to webpack in terms of flexibility, development experience, and community extensions. Below are a few topics on why electron-webpack can be considerably better.\nHot Module Replacement\nelectron-webpack provides HMR for virtually all code in both main and renderer processes. electron-compile is currently limited to live reloading, which is enough for certain enviroments, but works for only a handful of file types. If you've worked with HMR before, then you definitly know it is something you can not live without afterwards.\nRuntime Dependencies\nSince electron-compile \"compiles JS and CSS on the fly\", it currently adds extra dependencies into the scope of your project. Sure, a small handful of modules isn't a big deal, but keeping production size down in the end is always important when distributing electron applications.\nFaster Build Times\nInternally, electron-webpack takes advantage of happypack to create multiple worker threads. Combined with Dll support, build times can be significatly faster. It even has some additional optimizations for TypeScript users. And let's be honest, especially for large-scale applications, who doesn't want faster build times?\nWebpack Community\nWhen using electron-compile you are limited to a specific set of features. Sure you have most of the important ones covered, you just don't get an amazing and large community that webpack can provide. There are countless loaders and plugins to cover just about everything you may ever need. Not only is the community constantly implementing new tools, electron is explicitly support by the webpack team.\nIn the end, electron-compile is still a fantastic tool when you need to quickly prototype a project together. It can even be enough for smaller scale applications that may not need all the fancy bells and whistles. But for those accustomed to HMR or developing larger scale applications, electron-webpack has you covered.\n"}}}
