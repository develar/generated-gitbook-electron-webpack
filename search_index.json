\n\nBecause setting up webpack in the electron environment shouldn't be difficult.\n\nOverview\nModern web development practices today require a lot of setup with things like webpack to bundle your code, babel for transpiling, eslint for linting, and so much more that the list just goes on. Unfortunaly when creating electron applications, all of that setup just became much more difficult. The primary aim of electron-webpack is to eliminate all preliminary setup with one simple install so you can get back to developing your application.\n\nWhy create a module and not a full boilerplate?\n\nIf you've been in the JavaScript world for even a short period of time, you are very aware that things are always changing, and development setup is no exclusion. Putting all development scripts into a single updatable module just makes sense. Sure a full featured boilerplate works too, but doing also involves needing to manually update those pesky webpack configuration files that some may call magic when something new comes out.\nHere are some of the awesome features you'll find using electron-webpack...\n\nDetailed documentation\nUse of webpack for source code bundling\nUse of webpack-dev-server for development\nHMR for both renderer and main processes\nUse of babel-preset-env that is automatically configured based on your electron version\nAdd-ons to support items like TypeScript, Less, EJS, etc.\n\nQuick Start\nGet started fast with electron-webpack-quick-start.\n# copy template using curl\ncurl -fsSL https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-webpack-quick-start/archive/master.tar.gz | tar -xz --strip-components 1\n\n# or copy template using git clone\ngit clone https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-webpack-quick-start.git\ncd electron-webpack-quick-start\nrm -rf .git\n\n# install dependencies\nyarn\n\nIf you already have an existing project, or are looking for a custom approach outside of the quick start template, make sure to read over the Core Concepts, Project Structure, and Development sections of electron-webpack's documentaiton.\nNext Steps\nMake sure to take advantage of the detailed documentation that electron-webpack provides. It covers everything from how things work internally, adding custom configurations, and building your application.\n"},"core-concepts":{"url":"core-concepts","title":"Core Concepts","keywords":"","body":"Core Concepts\nBelow is a general overview of what electron-webpack aims to solve, and what it isn't.\nelectron-webpack is a module\nIt is not a fully featured boilerplate; it is a single updatable package. It includes many webpack configurations to help jump-start your development needs. If you are looking for a boilerplate to get started, please see electron-webpack-quick-start.\nelectron-webpack has a CLI\nYou can take use of a few useful commands such as running in development and compiling you source code (more info).\nelectron-webpack can be extended\nBy using electron-webpack you are not restricted to any sort of API abstraction of webpack. Although there are Add-ons made available to simplify smaller tasks, the entirety of webpack's documentation is fully applicable (more info).\nelectron-webpack is agnostic\nAside from setting up core webpack configurations with babel-preset-env and making optimizations specific to the electron environment, electron-webpack does its best to not impose or encourage any sort of project structure or build cycle. Just as stated before, this is a module and can be used as tool outside of its CLI.\n"},"development":{"url":"development","title":"Development","keywords":"","body":"Development\nInstallation\nSince electron-webpack is a module, not a boilerplate, let's install that and few other dependencies.\nyarn add electron-webpack electron webpack --dev\nyarn add source-map-support\n\nStarting in development mode\nBy default, electron-webpack expects, at minimum, a main process entry point in src/main/index.js (more info). Once you have your entry files setup, you can run electron-webpack dev to get started. To make things easier, make use of setting up a script in your package.json to start your application in development mode.\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"electron-webpack dev\"\n  }\n}\n\nIf you are using electron-webpack-quick-start and have already installed dependecies, simply run the follwing to open your application in development mode.\nyarn dev\n\n\nSource Aliases\nelectron-webpack provides a few source aliases, or path mappings as TypeScript would call it, that allow you to import your modules easier.\n\n@: Provides path to corresponding process (main or renderer)\ncommon: Provides path to common source directory\n\n\nA little note on the magic\nelectron-webpack may seem like a magical module to some from the outside, but let's cover a few topics about what's going on under the hood.\nHot Module Replacement\nWebpack HMR has been setup to support both the renderer and main process. This allows for faster development ensuring your application is only restarted when neccessary.\nBundling for both renderer and main processes\nwebpack is already setup to have an entry point for each process. In addition, you can also easily add further entry points to the main process when needed. In the other cases where you just need support for the main process, you can even skip the renderer process when needed (more info).\nUse of html-webpack-plugin\nYou might notice that you don't need an index.html to get started on your application. That's because it is created for you, as it adds in a few extra configruations needed for the electron environment. If you are creating an electron application with webpack, you are most likely creating a Single Page Application anyways. So because of that, there is already a  provided in the markup that you can mount your application onto.\n\nA Note for Windows Users\nIf you run into errors while installing dependencies, related to node-gyp, then you most likely do not have the proper build tools installed on your system. Build tools include items like Python and Visual Studio.\nYou can quickly install these build tools by globally installing windows-build-tools. It provides many items like Visuall C++ packages, Python, and much more.\n"},"add-ons":{"url":"add-ons","title":"Add-ons","keywords":"","body":"Add-ons\nAlthough electron-webpack is provided as a single module, you can also install add-ons. Add-ons are made available to help setup certain frameworks that may require a lot of extra configuration or dependencies, such as TypeScript or Vue.js.\nThese add-ons are completely optional and may not support all use cases.

If you are unfamiliar with the webpack.DllPlugin plugin, make sure to read its documenation to better understand what problem it attempts to solve. In short, this can be used to drastically improve build time performance.\nThrough custom configurations electron-webpack provides a place to define specific packages you would like to create a separate bundle for. You can treat this feature as a way to bundle all of your vendor libraries together.\nOnce you have defined your modules, you can simply run electron-webpack dll to produce a vendor bundle that will be referenced in your final compilation. Let's go through that step-by-step.\nDefine your modules\nHere we are defining our modules in package.json. If you prefer, you can also create a separate file for your configurations (more info).\n{\n  \"electronWebpack\": {\n    \"renderer\": {\n      \"dll\": [\n        \"fooModule\",\n        \"barModule\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nCreate the vendor bundle\nOnce you have choosen your selected modules, you can run the below command to create your vendor bundle.\nelectron-webpack dll\n\nIt may be beneficial to create a package.json script for this command if you plan to use it often.\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"compile:dll\": \"electron-webpack dll\"\n  }\n}\n\nFinal Notes\nNow that your vendor bundle is created, you can move forward with the standard electron-webpack compilation process.\nPlease know that the vendor bundle is only created when you explicity run electron-webpack dll. For most cases, you may only need to run this one time. But as you add/remove modules or even update those modules, you will need to re-run the command to create an updated bundle.\nUsing a postinstall hook\nOne common practice when using Dll bundle splitting to define a postinstall command to create the vendor bundle whenever new dependecies are installed. This can help ensure everything is up to date so you don't have to manually run this yourself.\npackage.json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"postinstall\": \"electron-webpack dll\"\n  }\n}\n\n"},"environment-variables":{"url":"environment-variables","title":"Environment Variables","keywords":"","body":"Environment Variables\nSometimes you need your webpack build to be dependent upon specific environment variables.

We can set an environment variable to define the base Url that axios can use.\nSet our environment variable\n# linux and darwin systems\nELECTRON_WEBPACK_APP_API_URL=\"http://dev.domain.com/api\"\n\n# win32 systems\nset ELECTRON_WEBPACK_APP_API_URL=\"http://dev.domain.com/api\"\n\nReference that variable in our code\nimport axios from 'axios'\n\naxios.defaults.baseURL = process.env.ELECTRON_WEBPACK_APP_API_URL\n\n"},"extending-as-a-library":{"url":"extending-as-a-library","title":"Extending as a Library","keywords":"","body":"Extending as a Library\nOne of the great benefits of using electron-webpack is that the entirity of webpack's documenation still applies. You can easily skip using the provided CLI and modify the configurations to meet your needs. Since electron uses a multi-process architecture, there are also multiple webpack configurations. Let's cover what's provided.\nConfiguration Files\n\nelectron-webpack/webpack.main.config.js (main process)\nelectron-webpack/webpack.renderer.config.js (renderer process)\nelectron-webpack/webpack.renderer.dll.config.js (Dll bundle spliting)\nelectron-webpack/webpack.app.config.js (combination of all configurations above)\n\nIf you are wanting to look at these configurations internally, you can easily do the following to print them into your console. Notice that each configuration returns a Promise.\nconst webpackMain = require('electron-webpack/webpack.main.config.js')\nconst { inspect } = require('util')\n\nwebpackMain().then(config => {\n  console.log(inspect(config, {\n    showHidden: false,\n    depth: null,\n    colors: true\n  }))\n})\n\nAdding a Custom Loader/Plugin\nLet's say we need to support *.txt files in our renderer process and want to use the raw-loader to do so, here's how we can get that setup.\nInstall raw-loader\nyarn add -D raw-loader\n\nmyCustomWebpack.renderer.config.js\nconst webpackRenderer = require('electron-webpack/webpack.renderer.config.js')\n\nmodule.exports = env => {\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n\n    /* get provided config */\n    webpackRenderer(env).then(rendererConfig => {\n\n      /* add `raw-loader` */\n      rendererConfig.module.rules.push({\n        test: /\\.txt$/,\n        use: 'raw-loader'\n      })\n\n      /* return modified config to webpack */\n      resolve(rendererConfig)\n    })\n  })\n}\n\nNow with your new custom webpack configuration file, you can use the native webpack CLI.\nwebpack --config myCustomWebpack.renderer.config.js\n\n"},"using-static-assets":{"url":"using-static-assets","title":"Using Static Assets","keywords":"","body":"Using Static Assets\nWhen using webpack to bundle all of our assets together we lose the ability to provide a full path to our assets. This is especially important when we need to use modules like fs or those that require a file path to an asset. electron-webpack is aware of that issue and provides a solution.\nYou may have noticed in Project Structure there is a directory specifically for static assets (static/). It is here where we can put assets we explicity don't want webpack to bundle. So now how can we access their path?\nUsing the __static variable\nSimilar to how __dirname can provide you with a path to the parent directory name when working in a Node.js environment, __static is made available to provide you a path to your static/ folder. This variable is available in both development and production.\nUse Case\nLet's say we have a static Text file (foobar.txt) we need to read into our application using fs. Here's how we can use the __static variable to get a reliable path to our asset.\nstatic/foobar.txt\nfoobarbizzbuzz\n\nsomeScript.js (main or renderer process)\nimport fs from 'fs'\nimport path from 'path'\n\n/* use `path` to create the full path to our asset */\nconst pathToAsset = path.join(__static, '/foobar.txt')\n\n/* use `fs` to consume the path and read our asset */\nconst fileContents = fs.readFileSync(pathToAsset, 'utf8')\n\nconsole.log(fileContents)\n// => \"foobarbizzbuzz\"\n\n"},"project-structure":{"url":"project-structure","title":"Project Structure","keywords":"","body":"Project Structure\nEverybody likes to structure their projects differently, and electron-webpack is aware of that. For the most part, the only configurations needed are entry points for webpack to step in.\nIf you are looking to follow common electron practices or wanting an example template, make sure to check out electron-webpack-quick-start. It has the bare minimun setup, but can be easily modified to meet many needs. The use of this template, of course, is optional.\nDefault Structure\nBelow is the default file tree that electron-webpack expects without any custom configuration. Please know that source directories can be adjusted to meet your needs (more info).\nmy-project/\n├─ src/\n│  ├─ main/\n│  │  └─ index.js\n│  ├─ renderer/\n│  │  └─ index.js\n│  └─ common/\n└─ static/\nMain Process (src/main/)\nHere you can add all of your main process code.\nRenderer Process (src/renderer/) [optional]\nHere you can add all of your renderer process code. Bundling of the renderer process is optional for cases where you may want to use an external tool such as electron-next. Notice that there isn't a entry index.html, that's because it is created for you (more info).\nCommon Scripts (src/common/) [optional]\nThis is a convenient place where you can place utility type files that you expect to use between both processes. Thanks to webpack aliasing, you can easily import files from here using the common alias.\nStatic Assets (static/) [optional]\nThere are some instances were we may not want webpack to bundle particular assets, like those being consumed by modules like fs. Here is where we can put them and then reliably access them in both development and production (more info).\nwebpack entry points\nOne important thing to notice is that electron-webpack expects that your main process and renderer process source code is separated using different directories.\nWithin each process's directory, one of the following entry files is expected...\n\nindex.js / main.js\nindex.ts / main.ts (when using the TypeScript add-on)\n\nThe entry files are the main starting point of your webpack bundle, so everything found within its dependency tree will be bundled.\n"},"building":{"url":"building","title":"Building","keywords":"","body":"Building\nOne important thing to understand is that electron-webpack is agnostic about the build tool you decide to use for creating your distributable electron application. The only concern of this module is to create a webpack output that functions properly and is optimized for the electron enviroment.\nCompiling your code\nOnce you have electron-webpack configured for your project, you can simply run the electron-webpack command to compile your source code. To make things easier, make use of setting up a script in your package.json.\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"compile\": \"electron-webpack\"\n  }\n}\n\nAfter running the above script with yarn compile, you now have a webpack output located in the dist/ directory.\nBuilding a distribution\nNow that electron-webpack has created your webpack bundle, you can simply implement any build tool you would like. One thing to note is that additional optimizations have been made to work with electron-builder. This build tool is perfect for any sized application, providing many features from creating installable executables to providing \"auto update\" support. electron-webpack also interally provides a base configuration for electron-builder.\nUsing electron-builder\nInstall\nyarn add electron-builder --dev\n\nAdd additional package.json scripts\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    /* compile source code and create webpack output */\n    \"compile\": \"electron-webpack\",\n\n    /* `yarn compile` & create distribution */\n    \"dist\": \"yarn compile && electron-builder\",\n\n    /* `yarn dist` & create unpacked distribution */\n    \"dist:dir\": \"yarn dist -- --dir -c.compression=store -c.mac.identity=null\"\n  }\n}\n\nFurther configurations can be made in accordance to electron-builder's documentation.\nFinal Notes\nWhen configuring your build tool of choice, just be sure to point to the dist/ directory where your compiled application lives (this is already the default of electron-builder). Any questions or issues that may arise during the build step should be directed towards the respected build tool, and not electron-webpack.\n"},"dependency-management":{"url":"dependency-management","title":"Dependency Management","keywords":"","body":"Dependency Management\nWhen creating electron applications, dependency management can be a little different for specific cases. To make sure everybody is on the same page, make sure to take a look at the below documentation.\nUsing yarn\nAs previously mentioned, the use of the yarn package manager is strongly recommened, as opposed to npm. Aside from a more stable dependency tree, one other major benefit to using yarn is the ability to clean your node_modules to help eliminate redudant files that will help reduce your application's final build size.\npackage.json\ndependencies\nThese dependencies will be included in your final production application. If your application needs a certain module to function, then install it here!\ndevDependencies\nThese dependecies will not be included in your final production application. Here you can install modules needed specifically for development, like build scripts, task runners, webpack accessories, etc.\nInstalling Native Node Modules\nWhen using native node modules, those written in C/C++, we need to ensure they are built against electron's packaged node version. We can use electron-builder's install-app-deps command to rebuild those modules to resolve any conflicts we might run into.\nRunning install-app-deps\nyarn add electron-builder --dev\n./node_modules/.bin/electron-builder install-app-deps\n\nIt may also be worth adding a package.json script for this command if you plan on using it often (yarn rebuild-deps).\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"rebuild-deps\": \"electron-builder install-app-deps\"\n  }\n}\n\nIf you choose not to use electron-builder as your build tool, you can still run the command using npx without side affects.\n# Using `npm@^5.2.0`\nnpx electron-builder install-app-deps\n\nFinal Notes\nIf you do expect your application to use native node modules, it is highly recommened to use electron-builder for your build tool as it handles these conflicts for you during the build step.\n"},"technical-differences-of-electron-compile":{"url":"technical-differences-of-electron-compile","title":"Technical Differences of electron-compile","keywords":"","body":"Technical Differences of electron-compile\n\nElectron supporting package to compile JS and CSS in Electron applications\n\nelectron-compile is a great package that offers a zero configuration setup without a predefine project structure. It surely has its place in the community, but just isn't comparable to webpack in terms of flexibility, development experience, and community extensions. Below are a few topics on why electron-webpack can be considerably better.\nHot Module Replacement\nelectron-webpack provides HMR for virtually all code in both main and renderer processes. electron-compile is currently limited to live reloading, which is enough for certain enviroments, but works for only a handful of file types. If you've worked with HMR before, then you definitly know it is something you can not live without afterwards.\nRuntime Dependencies\nSince electron-compile \"compiles JS and CSS on the fly\", it currently adds extra dependencies into the scope of your project. Sure, a small handful of modules isn't a big deal, but keeping production size down in the end is always important when distributing electron applications.\nFaster Build Times\nInternally, electron-webpack takes advantage of happypack to create multiple worker threads. Combined with Dll support, build times can be significatly faster. It even has some additional optimizations for TypeScript users. And let's be honest, especially for large-scale applications, who doesn't want faster build times?\nWebpack Community\nWhen using electron-compile you are limited to a specific set of features. Sure you have most of the important ones covered, you just don't get an amazing and large community that webpack can provide. There are countless loaders and plugins to cover just about everything you may ever need. Not only is the community constantly implementing new tools, electron is explicitly support by the webpack team.\nIn the end, electron-compile is still a fantastic tool when you need to quickly prototype a project together. It can even be enough for smaller scale applications that may not need all the fancy bells and whistles. But for those accustomed to HMR or developing larger scale applications, electron-webpack has you covered.\n"}}}
